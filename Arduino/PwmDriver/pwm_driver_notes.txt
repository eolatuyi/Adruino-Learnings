- Use Timer/Counter peripheral to realize PWM output: 
Need to abstract the Timer/Counter peripheral interface that is platform independent and 
write a platform specific driver. pwm driver is meant to be platform independent as much as possible

OC1A/PCINT1 â€“ Port B, Bit 1
â€“ OC1A: Output Compare Match output. The PB1 pin can serve as an external output for the
Timer/Counter1 Compare Match A. The PB1 pin has to be configured as an output (DDB1 set
(one)) to serve this function. The OC1A pin is also the output pin for the PWM mode timer
function.

SS/OC1B/PCINT2 â€“ Port B, Bit 2
- OC1B: Output Compare Match output. The PB2 pin can serve as an external output for the
Timer/Counter1 Compare Match B. The PB2 pin has to be configured as an output (DDB2 set
(one)) to serve this function. The OC1B pin is also the output pin for the PWM mode timer
function.

MOSI/OC2A/PCINT3 â€“ Port B, Bit 3
â€“ OC2A: Output Compare Match output. The PB3 pin can serve as an external output for the
Timer/Counter2 Compare Match A. The PB3 pin has to be configured as an output (DDB3 set
'1') to serve this function. The OC2A pin is also the output pin for the PWM mode timer
function.
